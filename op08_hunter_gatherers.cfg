// HUNTER-GATHERERS

//
// * Killed enemies will drop dogtags that anyone can pick up
// * Collecting dogtags from the enemy team awards victory points
// * Killing enemies with the DM bonus weapon makes them drop an extra dogtag
// * The team with the most victory points at the end of the time limit wins.
// * Voice chat during the game is only with your team to encourage team coordination.

// These affect your deathmatch score, which does 2 things
// 1) The highest scoring player on the winning team is MVP.
// 2) Awards xp.  Since each kill generates a dogtag, a kill
//    is now worth ~14 points instead of ~11 points, so dogtag
//    mode will generate 27% more xp.
